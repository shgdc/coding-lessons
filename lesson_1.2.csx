// Below the method is also called with a single text argument.
// The difference is that the argument is not a simple value.
// Instead, it is an expression.
// The below expression contains simple values and operators.
// Operators take one or more values and turn them into one result value.
// The process of determining the value of an expression is called evaluation.
// What is the value of the expression below?
Console.WriteLine("Hello" + " " + "World");
